project objective :
                    Extract the data, Clean data, Pre -process data, Manipulate Data, Data Analysis and Data Visualization.
Have performed EDA Exploratory Data Analysis on Comcast Telecom complaints dataset.
In this project I extracted and performed manipulations on the data using pandas library. I applied various algebraic computations using numpy. I used matplotlib, seaborn for analysis and visualization. The data pipeline used in this project is data extraction, Data Cleaning, Data Pre -processing, Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization.

this project actually helped me to get actual insights of real world data to interact with actual challenges faced during services of the above related services.
